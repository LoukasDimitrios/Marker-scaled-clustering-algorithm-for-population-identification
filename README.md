# Developing a marker-scaled clustering algorithm for improved population identification in single cell cytometry data



## Introduction:
The immune system is crucial for human health, comprising innate and adaptive immunity. Understanding immune cell subsets aids in diagnosing and treating immune-related disorders. Single-cell cytometry, particularly mass cytometry (CyTOF), offers detailed insights into immune cell behavior but faces challenges in data analysis due to its complexity.

## Objective:
The primary goal is to develop a marker-scaled clustering method for single-cell cytometry data analysis. This method aims to overcome limitations of manual gating and existing automated techniques by integrating biological knowledge directly into the analysis process.

## Approach:
The algorithm incorporates predefined marker groups identified by immunologists, bridging the gap between computational clustering and biological understanding. By integrating expert-defined marker groups, the method aims to identify clusters both statistically significant and biologically meaningful.

## Methodology:
The study analyzes raw mass cytometry data and two marker-scaled datasets using PhenoGraph and Seurat algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) adjusts marker group weights and aids visual interpretation. Clustering parameters are evaluated using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to ensure effective cluster identification.
